# Netflix-Analysis
Final Project at Wozu

For my final project I wanted to do an analysis utilizing Netflix datasets to determine correlations between TV and movie ratings (TV-MA, PG-13, etc.) and IMDB scores. Also determined correlations between rated content based on regions and countries. 

- Process: Data wrangling, data visualization, statistical regressions, dataset management 
- Tools: Jupyter, Python, R, Tableau, Microsoft Powerpoint, Microsoft Excel.
